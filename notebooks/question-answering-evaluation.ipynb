Not suitable for professional contexts.- Score 2: Language is casual but generally respectful and avoids strong informality or slang. Acceptable in some informal professional settings.- Score 3: Language is balanced and avoids extreme informality or formality. Suitable for most professional contexts. - Score 4: Language is noticeably formal, respectful, and avoids casual elements. Appropriate for business or academic settings. - Score 5: Language is excessively formal, respectful, and avoids casual elements. Appropriate for the most formal settings such as textbooks. \n",
